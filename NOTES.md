# Notes

## Screen reader

- ask for show of hands
- explain the different screen readers up front

- Link outside in the sun example to situational slide from Ben

- "We follow the apple recommendation on inputs (44px height and width)"
- Think about asking people to consider watching screen reader users in action
- Credit the form example to Adam Silver in Form Design Patterns
