    <p>
      The Granny Smith is a tip-bearing apple cultivar, which originated in
      Australia in 1868. It is named after Maria Ann Smith, who propagated the
      cultivar from a chance seedling. The tree is thought to be a hybrid of
      Malus sylvestris, the European wild apple, with the North American apple
      Malus pumila as the polleniser.

      The fruit is hard, with a light green skin and crisp, juicy flesh. The
      flavour is tart and acidic, which possibly limits raw consumption.
      However, it remains firm when baked, making it a very popular cooking
      apple used in pies, where it can be sweetened. The apple goes from being
      completely green to turning yellow when overripe.
    </p>

      It is claimed to be the third most popular apple in America by the US
      Apple Association.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Granny Smith was one of four apples honored by the United States
      Postal Service in a 2013 set of four 33Â¢ stamps commemorating historic
      strains, joined by Northern Spy, Baldwin, and Golden Delicious.
